## Our brief

"We will be using our new found useEffect skills to make a random pokemon generator. We are going to make a component PokemonViewer, which will take in a prop of `id`. When the `id` prop changes, our component will perform an HTTP request to get the pokemon of that id, and then display the data"

Within a useEffect, fetch a Pokemon from `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${id}` and store
the data in your piece of state. The useEffect should only re-run when the id changes.

## Main Learning Points:
- Implementing useEffect to fetch data from an API within React.
- Using conditional rendering with a 'loading' state to show loading animation. 
- Fetch request is dynamic - 'id' state sets a random number between 1-150 using Math.random initial load.
- The 'id' state is then reset to a random number when 'Get Random Pokémon' button is pressed.
- Arrow buttons increment and decrement 'id' state +-1.
- Utilising the box model to build the Pokémon card graphics using CSS
- Uses a switch statement to  set the state for the background color of the card dependent on the pokemon 'type'.

Built with:
